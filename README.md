## Slices: a package for manipulating Golang's slice data type

This package implements some slice operations not provided by Golang's internal packages. Here are some of them:

RemoveFromStringSlice () - Deletes all occurences of a string, from a slice

IsElementInStringSlice () - Tells if there is any occurence of a string, in a slice

IndexInStringSlice () - Tells the index of the first occurence of a string

Check file "slices.go", for more info about the usage of the functions in this package.
